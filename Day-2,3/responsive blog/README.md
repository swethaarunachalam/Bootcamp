A responsive blog in HTML and CSS uses structured elements like `<header>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, and `<nav>` to organize content such as posts, images, and navigation links. CSS is employed with media queries to adjust the layout, fonts, and images to ensure the blog looks great on devices of all screen sizes.
